# [Project 1: Autoregression Forecast Model](https://github.com/shanenemeth/Autoregression)
* Analyzed time series data of airline passangers between 1949-1960
* Decomposed time series
* Forecasted airline passengers for the next 4 years

# [Project 2: Multiple Linear Regression using Best Subset Selection](https://github.com/shanenemeth/Regfit)
* Analyzed dataset of MLB players with  observations of 20 variables to try and predict player Salary
* Cleansed data, ommiting missing values for Salary variable
* Used best subset selection regression technique to produce the best model for predicting player Salary 
* Identified model 11 as the best fit for the data, using adjusted r squared as the criteria 

# [Project 3: Logit Regression to Predict Diabetes](https://github.com/shanenemeth/Logistic-Regression-)
* Analyzed a diabetes dataset to create a model to predict whether and observation has diabetes using logit regression 
* Split dataset into training and testing subsets 
* Utilized ROCR package to determine best threshold and performance for the model
* Created a plot of the performance using true positive rate and false positive rate as the axes to determine best threshold for the model and reduce the false positive rate 
* Accuracy of the model was .76
